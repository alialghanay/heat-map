This project was created to pass [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Visualize Data with a Heat Map Challenge.


## Available Scripts

project [gh-page](https://alialghanay.github.io/heat-map/).

## Project User Story 
### 1: 
My heat map should have a title with a corresponding `id="title"`.

### 2:
My heat map should have a description with a corresponding `id="description"`.

### 3:
My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding `id="x-axis"`.

### 4:
My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding `id="y-axis"`.

### 5:
My heat map should have `rect` elements with a `class="cell"` that represent the data.

### 6:
There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.

### 7:
Each cell will have the properties `data-month`, `data-year`, `data-temp` containing their corresponding `month`, `year`, and `temperature` values.

### 8:
The `data-month`, `data-year` of each cell should be within the range of the data.

### 9:
My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.

### 10:
My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.

### 11:
My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.

### 12:
My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.

### 13:
My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding `id="legend"`.

### 14:
My legend should contain `rect` elements.

### 15:
The `rect` elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.

### 16:
I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding `id="tooltip"` which displays more information about the area.

### 17:
My tooltip should have a `data-year` property that corresponds to the `data-year` of the active area.
